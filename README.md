# tandem-fe

Tandem is a social app for finding friends to join you on your next bike ride. Users can sign in with their Strava account and join other user’s open rides or create their own custom ride for others to join. Rides can be assigned a route from Strava, and are labelled by location, recommended bike type and experience level. Users can view route maps, take part in ride discussions, and view all rides they’re currently attending.
